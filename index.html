           <h2>Mountain</h2>
           <p>A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, 
               usually in the form of a peak.[1] A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. 
               Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. 
               These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. 
               Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. 
               A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.
